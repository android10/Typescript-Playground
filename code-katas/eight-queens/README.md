Eight Queens Kata

This kata is based on the classic chess rules. You must put eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that none of them is able to capture any other using the standard chess queen’s moves.

Tips: you could have only one queen by row and column.

## Step 1

Use multiple TDD loops to build a programm they find all solutions.

## Tree traversal

    Rewrite a new programm to use a Depth-first walk.
    Rewrite a new programm to use a Breadth-first walk.
    Compare performances and lisibility

## Nontraditional approaches

In this part we whant to find only one solution.

    Use a genetic algorithms to solve this puzzle.
    Use a minimum-conflicts heuristic to solve this puzzle.
    Use other metaheuristic algorithms like Simulated annealing or random to solve this puzzle.
    Compare performances

## Brute-force

    Build a programm they use brute-force and compare performances
